# Test Execution Report

**Date**: 2025-08-31  
**Status**: Partial Success

## Summary

Tests have been executed across the NLM codebase with the following results:

## Package Test Results

### ✅ Passing Packages

| Package | Status | Coverage | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| `internal/batchexecute` | ✅ PASS | 65.8% | All decoder tests passing |
| `internal/api` (partial) | ✅ PASS | 1.7% | Non-auth tests passing |
| `cmd/nlm` (partial) | ✅ PASS | - | Auth command tests passing |

### ⚠️ Packages with Issues

| Package | Issue | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `internal/api` (full) | FAIL | Tests require authentication credentials |
| `cmd/nlm` (scripttest) | TIMEOUT | Script tests hanging, need investigation |
| `internal/auth` | N/A | No test files |
| `internal/rpc` | N/A | No test files |

## Successful Test Suites

### 1. Pathway Tests (internal/api)
```
✅ TestPathwayStructure
  - Default configuration uses generated pathway
  - Legacy configuration via services = nil
  - Can switch between pathways
  - Migration is 81.1% complete

✅ TestPathwayValidationFramework
  - Framework capabilities verified
  - Test strategy documented
```

### 2. MIME Type Detection (internal/api)
```
✅ TestDetectMIMEType
  - XML file detection working
  - Extension and content-based detection
```

### 3. BatchExecute Decoder (internal/batchexecute)
```
✅ TestDecodeResponse
  - List notebooks response parsing
  - Error response handling
  - Multiple chunk types
  - Authentication errors
  - Nested JSON structures
  - YouTube source additions
```

### 4. CLI Command Validation (cmd/nlm)
```
✅ TestAuthCommand
  - Help commands working
  - All command validation passing
  - Error messages correct
```

## Tests Requiring Authentication

The following tests require `NLM_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NLM_COOKIES` environment variables:

- `TestListProjectsWithRecording`
- `TestCreateProjectWithRecording`
- `TestAddSourceFromTextWithRecording`
- `TestSimplePathwayValidation`
- `TestPathwayMigrationStatus`
- `TestNotebookCommands_*` (all comprehensive tests)

## Coverage Analysis

| Component | Coverage | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| BatchExecute | 65.8% | Good - Core functionality well tested |
| API Client | 1.7% | Low - Most tests need auth |
| Overall | ~30% | Needs improvement with auth tests |

## Recommendations

1. **Set up test authentication** - Create test credentials for CI/CD
2. **Fix timeout issues** - Investigate hanging script tests in cmd/nlm
3. **Add unit tests** - Create tests for auth and rpc packages
4. **Increase coverage** - Add more non-auth dependent tests
5. **Mock external calls** - Use test doubles for API calls

## Test Execution Commands

### Run passing tests only:
```bash
go test ./internal/api -run "^(TestDetectMIMEType|TestPathwayStructure|TestPathwayValidationFramework)$"
go test ./internal/batchexecute
go test ./cmd/nlm -run TestAuthCommand
```

### Run with coverage:
```bash
go test ./internal/batchexecute -cover
go test ./internal/api -cover -run "^(TestDetectMIMEType|TestPathwayStructure)$"
```

### Skip long tests:
```bash
go test ./... -short -timeout 30s
```

## Conclusion

The test suite is partially functional with key components tested:
- ✅ Pathway migration framework validated
- ✅ Core decoding logic tested (65.8% coverage)
- ✅ Command validation working
- ⚠️ Full integration tests require authentication
- ⚠️ Some script tests have timeout issues

The pathway testing framework successfully validates the dual pathway architecture and confirms the 81.1% migration to generated services is working correctly.
